# Voting-System

This code implements a simple voting system using the Tkinter library in Python.
The program allows users to vote for one of three political parties: BJP, Congress, or AAP.
It also provides a feature to display the current voting results.
Additionally, the code uses the pyttsx3 library to provide audio feedback for each vote cast.
This code creates a basic GUI voting application where users can vote for one of three political parties. 
The interface provides buttons for casting votes and a button to display the current results.
Each vote is acknowledged with an audio message and a confirmation dialog. 
The program is a simple demonstration of how to create interactive applications with Tkinter and how to use text-to-speech functionality in Python.
